    Inherit from this if you want to create your own

    used by Evennia to create the automatic help entry for
    the command, so make sure to document consistently here.

    Each Command implements the following methods, called
    in this order:
        - at_pre_command(): If this returns True, execution is aborted.
        - parse(): Should perform any extra parsing needed on self.args
            and store the result on self.
        - func(): Performs the actual work.
        - at_post_command(): Extra actions, often things done after
            every command, like prompts.

                         often used (useful for commands like `help` or to

class MuxCommand(default_cmds.MuxCommand):
    """
    This sets up the basis for Evennia's 'MUX-like' command style.
    The idea is that most other Mux-related commands should
    just inherit from this and don't have to implement parsing of
    their own unless they do something particularly advanced.

    A MUXCommand command understands the following possible syntax:

        name[ with several words][/switch[/switch..]] arg1[,arg2,...] [[=|,] arg[,..]]

    The `name[ with several words]` part is already dealt with by the
    `cmdhandler` at this point, and stored in `self.cmdname`. The rest is stored
    in `self.args`.

    The MuxCommand parser breaks `self.args` into its constituents and stores them
    in the following variables:
        self.switches = optional list of /switches (without the /).
        self.raw = This is the raw argument input, including switches.
        self.args = This is re-defined to be everything *except* the switches.
        self.lhs = Everything to the left of `=` (lhs:'left-hand side'). If
                     no `=` is found, this is identical to `self.args`.
        self.rhs: Everything to the right of `=` (rhs:'right-hand side').
                    If no `=` is found, this is `None`.
        self.lhslist - `self.lhs` split into a list by comma.
        self.rhslist - list of `self.rhs` split into a list by comma.
        self.arglist = list of space-separated args (including `=` if it exists).

    All args and list members are stripped of excess whitespace around the
    strings, but case is preserved.
