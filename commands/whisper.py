    Whisper to one or more nearby targets.
    Syntax:
      whisper [target name, or names =[=] ][message]
    Usage:
       whisper A, B, C = text of message
    1) whisper text of message
    2) whisper A, B, C =
    3) whisper ==
    4) whisper =
    5) whisper
    *1 Omitting the target(s) and equal sign will whisper
       to the last whispered if message text is given.
    *2 Supplying target(s), an equal sign, but no message
      will set the target(s) for future whispers.
    *3 Supplying two equal signs without target(s) or
       message will set your next whisper to reply to
       the last whispered group.
    *4 Supplying only an equal sign without target(s) or
       message text will set your next whisper to the one
       who last whispered to you.
    *5 If no parameters are given, whisper will display
       the names of those whom you last whispered.
    * In some environments, message degradation may occur,
      similar to a mumble with only partial readability.
    Planned Options:
    /o or /ooc  - Out-of-character whispering.
    /t or /tel  - Telepathic whispering, if you and your
                  target(s) have enough combined telepathy.
